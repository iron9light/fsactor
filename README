fsactor = Finite State Machine + Actor
by IL (http://twitter.com/iron9light)

Here I use Akka's Actor(http://akkasource.org/)
fsactor let you change the state - receive partial function - at runtime.

After I finished this toy project,
I found I draw the simple Akka Actor back to the scala Actor view :)

Have fun!

    val fsactor = new FSActor {
      react {
        def act: PartialFunction[Any, Unit] = {
          case 1 =>
            results.append(1)
            react {
              case 2 =>
                results.append(2)
                react {
                  case 3 =>
                    results.append(3)
                    react(act)
                }
            }
        }

        act
      }
    }
